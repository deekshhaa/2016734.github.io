	<h5> KEYPAD </h5>

	<p> A keypad is a block or pad of buttons set with an arrangement of digits, symbols, or alphabetical letters. 
	    Pads mostly containing numbers and used with computers are numeric keypads. 
	    Keypads are found on devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, television remotes, push-button telephones, vending machines, 
            ATMs, point of sale terminals, combination locks, safes, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement. </p>
