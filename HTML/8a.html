	<h5> IMPORTNACE OF COFFEE IN INDIA </h5>

	<p> India is among the top 10 coffee-producing countries, with about 3% of the global output in 2020. 
	    Indian coffee is one of the best coffees in the world due to its high quality and gets a high premium in the international markets. 
	    India produces two types of coffee: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica has high market value than Robusta coffee due to its mild aromatic flavor. 
	    Robusta coffee is mainly used in making various blends due to its strong flavor. 
	    Robusta is the majorly manufactured coffee with a share of 72% of the total production. 
	    The industry provides direct employment to more than 2 million people in India. 
	    Since coffee is mainly an export commodity for India, domestic demand and consumption do not drastically impact the prices of coffee. </p>
