	<h5> IMPORTANCE OF SMART PHONES </h5>

	<p> Today, cellular phones do it all. Not only can you send texts, emails, and make calls, you have access to a full menu of computer capabilities as well. 
		In other words, anything you can do on a computer, you can perform on a smartphone. Plus, costs have come down so much that a standard device now 
		is within reach of most consumers.
		Free smartphones are a new development that means anyone who wants one of these powerful devices can get one.	
		 Thatâ€™s good news for consumers who sign up to get a lifeline program phone. For no cost at all, you get all the benefits of owning your 		
		own high-tech communications device that is at the center of modern social and business life.. </p>
